Music Collection of the People

This is a nascent set of software that will enable playing
music from a local (or locally-mounted) music collection.

The "Naming Convention of the People" must be followed in the
music library.  More detailed rules will follow, but it basically
means music is organized in paths like "band/album/song.ext".  For 
example:
/path/to/library/Replacements/Pleased to Meet Me/10 - Skyway.mp3

There will be three parts: a generic part that handles as much of
the work as possible, and then two adapters for Android phones and 
"normal" computers.  These adapters will be as small as possible.

The software is written in Java to make it easier to share between 
Android phones and desktops.
