Music Collection of the People

This is a set of software that will enable playing
music from a local (or locally-mounted) music collection.

The software is written in Java to make it easier to share between 
phones and desktops.

Currently, virtually all development is done on the Android app.  The
desktop program may be broken at any point in time.

There will be three parts: 

1) A "shared" layer that handles as much of the work as possible.  
   This is code will work on either computers or (Android) phones. 
 
2) A "computer" layer that adds to the shared layer.  This includes
   a Swing UI, an adapter for the sound card, and an adapter for the
   hard drive.  This code assumes the existence of a POSIX filesystem,
   and the Sox-provided "play" command.

3) An "android" layer that adds to the shared layer.  This will likewise
   include a UI, and audio and SDCard adapters.
