Music Collection of the People

This is a nascent set of software that will enable playing
music from a local (or locally-mounted) music collection.

The "Naming Convention of the People" must be followed in the
music library.  More detailed rules will follow, but it basically
means music is organized in paths like "band/album/song.ext".  For 
example:
/path/to/library/Replacements/Pleased to Meet Me/10 - Skyway.mp3

The software is written in Java to make it easier to share between 
phones and desktops.

There will be three parts: 

1) A "shared" layer that handles as much of the work as possible.  
   This is code will work on either computers or (Android) phones. 
 
2) A "computer" layer that adds to the shared layer.  This includes
   a Swing UI, an adapter for the sound card, and an adapter for the
   hard drive.  This code assumes the existence of a POSIX filesystem,
   and the Sox-provided "play" command.

3) An "android" layer that adds to the shared layer.  This will likewise
   include a UI, and audio and SDCard adapters.



To build everything:
$ ant jar
or just
$ ant

To build only shared components:
$ ant shared

To run on a computer:
