Because the various Android SDK tools expect to be in control of the whole
build process, and because some of the MCotP software has nothing at all
to do with Android, we've got a bit of a complicated system for where we 
keep the Android files and where we build.

The 'android' directory contains any changable files associated with the Android
build.  These files are checked into source control.

At build time, these files (along with the files in the 'shared' directory) are
copied into the 'android-build' directory, and then we delegate the build to the
Android SDK tools.  These tools only see the android-build directory and don't 
know about the rest of the code at all.

Nothing in the 'android-build' directory should ever be changed by hand, as 
they will be overwritten by our ant build.
